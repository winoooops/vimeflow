//! The four new trait splits introduced by Step B' of the v4-frozen
//! refactor plan (#246). Step 0c already extracted
//! [`crate::agent::adapter::types::TranscriptPathSource`] into the
//! types module; this file collects the four remaining splits in one
//! place so a reader can see the post-B' adapter contract at a
//! glance:
//!
//! - [`StatusSourceLocator`] — "where is the statusline file for this
//!   session" + the attach-time transcript hint (former
//!   `AgentAdapter::located_status_source`).
//! - [`StateDecoder`] — "given raw statusline content, what's the
//!   current snapshot" (former `AgentAdapter::parse_status`, now
//!   returning [`StatusSnapshot`] without `session_id`; the runtime
//!   stamps the session id when composing `AgentStatusEvent`).
//! - [`TranscriptPathValidator`] — "is this raw path safe to tail"
//!   (former `AgentAdapter::validate_transcript`).
//! - [`TranscriptStreamer`] — "spawn a thread that emits events from
//!   this JSONL" (former `AgentAdapter::tail_transcript`).
//!
//! All four are `pub(crate)` per frozen constraint #3. The existing
//! `AgentAdapter` trait stays alive in B' as a transitional façade —
//! `TranscriptState::start_or_replace` still takes `Arc<dyn AgentAdapter>`
//! and B'' (the next step) is where it migrates onto
//! `Arc<dyn TranscriptStreamer>`. Until then, each adapter struct
//! implements both `AgentAdapter` and the four split traits side by
//! side.
