//! Provider-neutral transcript tail engine (step C).
//!
//! Both the Claude Code and Codex transcript watchers previously carried a
//! near-identical `tail_loop`: read lines from a growing JSONL file, buffer a
//! trailing partial across the EOF poll boundary, strip CRLF, skip blank
//! lines, and hand each complete line to a provider-specific parser. This
//! module collapses that duplication into one [`TranscriptTailService`] driven
//! by an injected [`TranscriptDecoder`] — the decoder is the only
//! provider-specific seam.
//!
//! The loop owns the frozen line-buffering contract (F-EVENTS replay→live
//! boundary): a partial line survives a non-terminal EOF, [`on_caught_up`]
//! fires on **every** EOF where the partial buffer is empty (NOT just the
//! first — implementations MUST be idempotent, see the trait docstring), and
//! a read error warns + sleeps + continues rather than tearing the watcher
//! down. The empty-partial guard is load-bearing: firing the boundary signal
//! while a line is half-buffered would let decoders that flush replay-only
//! emitter state at that signal classify the straddling line — which started
//! during replay — as a live event when it eventually completes.
//!
