//! kimi-code session locator.
//!
//! Resolves the attach cwd to a `wire.jsonl` for the DETECTED kimi
//! process, in priority order:
//!
//! 1. proc-fd (Linux): if a wire flush is in progress, read the kimi process's
//!    open `agents/main/wire.jsonl` from `<proc_root>/<pid>/fd/*`, keep trusted
//!    main-wire candidates, and choose the most recently active one. Kimi may
//!    close the file between flushes, so an empty fd scan falls through.
//! 2. proc-environ (Linux): read the kimi process's own
//!    `KIMI_CODE_HOME` from `<proc_root>/<pid>/environ` so a per-process
//!    `KIMI_CODE_HOME=/tmp/kimi kimi` is honored.
//! 3. index fallback: `<kimi_home>/session_index.jsonl` workDir match.
//!    A `workDir` matches when it equals `cwd` OR is a component-boundary
//!    ancestor of it (kimi normalizes a worktree / subdirectory cwd to the
//!    repo root). Among matches the longest (deepest) workDir wins, then the
//!    process-owned session on Linux. A resumed Linux session is identified by
//!    the `session resume` diagnostic written at process startup because its
//!    original wire creation time predates the process. On macOS, where `/proc`
//!    cannot prove ownership, same-workDir ties use newest on-disk session
//!    activity so a resumed session keeps winning after kimi appends a later
//!    empty index row.
//! 4. exact-bucket sha256 scan: last-resort newest `session_*` under
//!    this cwd's `wd_<basename>_<hex>` bucket, gated on a `pty_start`
//!    mtime freshness check (no append ordering to tell current from
//!    stale, so a stale same-cwd bucket session must not win there).
//!
//! On macOS (no `/proc`, `proc_root == None`) steps 1-2 cleanly skip and
//! resolution falls through to the index / bucket fallbacks.
