# Module Boundaries

## Summary

Reusable utilities (formatters, helpers, pure functions) belong in dedicated
`utils/` modules — not in component files that happen to export them. When a
component file becomes a de-facto host for a utility, refactoring that
component (rename, split, extract sub-component) silently breaks every
external importer with no type-system warning until runtime.

The fix is preventive: when a second component needs a utility currently
defined in a sibling component file, **promote** the utility to a sibling
`utils/<name>.ts` and update the original component to import from there.
Don't widen the coupling by adding a second importer.

## Findings

### 1. `formatTokens` imported across components from a sibling component file

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #115 round 1 | 2026-04-30
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/agent-status/components/TokenCache.tsx`
- **Finding:** `TokenCache.tsx:9` imported `formatTokens` from `./BudgetMetrics`, a sibling presentational component file that happens to export the helper at line 11. This coupled two unrelated components at the module level — refactoring `BudgetMetrics.tsx` (splitting, renaming, extracting `MetricCell`) would have silently broken `TokenCache` with no compiler warning. The PR had already created `src/features/agent-status/utils/cacheRate.ts` for the cache-specific math; the natural home for a generic display formatter was a sibling `utils/format.ts`.
- **Fix:** Created `src/features/agent-status/utils/format.ts` with a single `formatTokens` export. Updated `BudgetMetrics.tsx`, `BudgetMetrics.test.tsx`, and `TokenCache.tsx` to import from the new module. Left `ContextBucket.tsx`'s own M-aware `formatTokens` (different implementation) alone — consolidating those two formatters would change ContextBucket's display behavior and is out of scope for the review-fix cycle.

### 2. Dual-form module exports (named + default) drift from sibling components' convention

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #173 round 1 | 2026-05-06
- **Severity:** LOW
- **File:** `src/features/workspace/components/StatusBar.tsx`
- **Finding:** New `StatusBar.tsx` shipped with both `export const StatusBar` and `export default StatusBar` — the latter was dead code (the sole consumer `WorkspaceView.tsx` uses the named import) and inconsistent with sibling components in the same directory: `IconRail` and `Sidebar` are named-only, while `BottomDrawer` is default-only. Adding both forms invites future contributors to follow either convention, multiplying the inconsistency over time. Some bundler tree-shaking paths also treat re-exported defaults differently, so the dual form has a small additional cost. Note (1-line stretch): this fits the broader "module boundaries" theme — what a file exports is part of its module shape, and shape inconsistency across siblings is a coupling smell similar to #1's cross-component utility import.
- **Fix:** Dropped `export default StatusBar`. Pattern is now: workspace-level chrome (`IconRail`, `Sidebar`, `StatusBar`) ships named-only; legacy components like `BottomDrawer` keep their default export until a future migration normalises. Code-review heuristic: when a new file lands in a directory, scan sibling files for export shape and match — not "support both forms defensively."

### 3. `TerminalZone` re-implemented `getVisibleSessions`'s open-status check inline instead of importing the canonical predicate

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #174 round 17 | 2026-05-07
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/workspace/components/TerminalZone.tsx`
- **Finding:** `TerminalZone` decided whether to wire `aria-labelledby` on each panel by recomputing `isActive || status === 'running' || status === 'paused'` inline. The exact same predicate (modulo the `isActive` half) lives in `pickNextVisibleSessionId.ts` as `isOpenSessionStatus`, which `Sidebar` and `SessionTabs` both consume. Today the two are equivalent, but the moment `isOpenSessionStatus` is widened (e.g. to admit a future `suspended` status), `TerminalZone`'s `hasVisibleTab` would silently lag — panels for the new status would emit `aria-labelledby={undefined}` even though `SessionTabs` would render a visible tab for them, breaking the WAI-ARIA tablist↔tabpanel linkage with no build error and no test failure. Same finding-class as #2 above (sibling-shape mismatch is a coupling smell) but the consequence here is functional, not stylistic.
- **Fix:** Imported `isOpenSessionStatus` from `../utils/pickNextVisibleSessionId`. Replaced the inline three-line OR with `isActive || isOpenSessionStatus(session.status)`. Updated the comment to state the canonical-predicate consumption rationale ("a future non-open status auto-flows into both visibility surfaces without TerminalZone needing a separate update"). Code-review heuristic: when two files in the same feature directory implement the same predicate inline, ONE of them should host the helper and the other(s) should consume it — and reviewers should flag the duplicate the moment the second copy lands, not after a status-set extension surfaces the drift.

### 4. Refactor splits a constructor — internal `codex_home` derivation desyncs between adapter and outer locator

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #261 round 1 | 2026-05-24
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `crates/backend/src/agent/adapter/bindings.rs`
- **Finding:** Step B' of the agent-adapter refactor moved `CompositeLocator` construction out of `CodexAdapter::new` and into `AgentBindings::for_attach`, but kept `CodexAdapter::new(pid, pty_start)` as the way to build the transitional `adapter_for_transcript_state`. `for_attach` derived `codex_home` from `ctx.provider_home`, then constructed two locators with potentially different homes: `bindings.locator = CompositeLocator::new(codex_home, ...)` and (inside `CodexAdapter::new`) a second `CompositeLocator::new(default_codex_home(), ...)`. Whenever `ctx.provider_home != default_codex_home()` (any test passing a custom home, or a future build-time override), `adapter.located_status_source()` would silently use the wrong root. Latent in B' (no live caller reached that path) but B''/D' migrations would inherit the mismatch unnoticed.
- **Fix:** Promoted the test-only `CodexAdapter::with_home(pid, pty_start, codex_home)` to `pub(crate)` so the adapter accepts the same `codex_home` that the outer `CompositeLocator` used. `for_attach` now computes `codex_home` once and clones it into both. Lesson: when refactoring a self-contained constructor (`CodexAdapter::new`) into a multi-site wiring (`for_attach`), every value the original constructor *derived* internally needs to flow through the new wiring as a single source of truth — not be re-derived at each call site.

### 5. Triplicated `StatusSnapshot → AgentStatusEvent` 8-field mapping across three modules

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #261 round 1 | 2026-05-24
- **Severity:** LOW
- **File:** `crates/backend/src/agent/adapter/base/watcher_runtime.rs` (and the duplicates in `claude_code/statusline.rs` + `codex/parser.rs`)
- **Finding:** Three byte-for-byte identical 8-field mappings of `(session_id, StatusSnapshot) → AgentStatusEvent` lived in `base/watcher_runtime::compose_event`, `claude_code/statusline::snapshot_to_event`, and the test-only `codex/parser::snapshot_to_event`. Required-field additions to `AgentStatusEvent` would compile-error at all three sites (struct-literal syntax), but an optional-field addition could silently drift if only the watcher path was updated. Triple-duplication is the canonical cross-module DRY violation that this pattern was built for (cf. #1 and #3).
- **Fix:** Promoted the mapping to `pub(crate) fn stamp_snapshot(session_id, StatusSnapshot) -> AgentStatusEvent` next to `StatusSnapshot` in `crate::agent::adapter::types`. All three call sites now delegate to it. Lesson: when a refactor extracts a session-id-free intermediate type (`StatusSnapshot`) deliberately to invert composition, the inverse stamping must be centralized too — otherwise every downstream call site re-implements the inversion and they drift on the next field addition.

### 6. Refactor surfaces what the old code absorbed — `dirs::home_dir() == None` becomes a hard-fail

- **Source:** github-codex-connector | PR #261 round 1 | 2026-05-24
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `crates/backend/src/agent/adapter/bindings.rs`
- **Finding:** Step B' moved `codex_home` derivation from `CodexAdapter::new` (which absorbed `dirs::home_dir() == None` via a `.codex` relative fallback) into `AgentBindings::for_attach`, which expected the typed `ctx.provider_home`. When that was `None`, `for_attach` returned `AttachError::LocatorFatal("Codex AttachContext has no provider_home")` rather than absorbing it. But `provider_home` is set via `dirs::home_dir().map(...)` in the central config registry — so it's `None` whenever the underlying call returns `None` (headless / service sessions with no resolvable `$HOME` / `/etc/passwd` entry). The refactor silently turned "works with relative `.codex`" into "Codex watcher fails to attach", a behavioral regression that disables status/transcript updates entirely in those environments. The reviewer's framing: "make sure the new wiring preserves the fallback the old constructor encapsulated, not just the happy path."
- **Fix:** Promoted `default_codex_home()` from a module-private `fn` to `pub(crate) fn` and replaced the `ok_or_else(|| LocatorFatal(...))` with `unwrap_or_else(default_codex_home)`. Renamed the test from `..._errors_locator_fatal` to `..._falls_back_to_default_home`. Updated `error.rs`'s module doc to mark `AttachError` infallible at the `for_attach` site (variants reserved for D'). Lesson: refactors that hoist a `fn`'s body into a new module shape must preserve *every* observable behavior that body encapsulated — not just the happy path. Convert "what does the old code do when its inputs are degenerate?" into a checklist item in the refactor design pass.
