# React Lifecycle

## Summary

React effects with async work or subscriptions must handle cleanup and guard
against state updates after unmount. Effect dependency arrays must be minimal
to avoid unintended re-runs (e.g., PTY respawning on every cwd change).

## Findings

### 1. PTY respawns on every cwd update via OSC 7

- **Source:** github-codex | PR #36 | 2026-04-09
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **File:** `src/features/terminal/hooks/useTerminal.ts`
- **Finding:** PTY spawn effect depends on `cwd`, so any directory change kills the running session and spawns a new one
- **Fix:** Decoupled spawning from cwd — treat cwd as initial spawn parameter stored in a ref
- **Commit:** `435e217 feat: interactive sidebar sessions, resizable panels, and real file explorer (#36)`

### 2. State updates after unmount in PTY spawn flow

- **Source:** github-codex | PR #34 | 2026-04-08
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/terminal/hooks/useTerminal.ts`
- **Finding:** `setDebugInfo()` called even when `isMountedRef.current` is false, triggering React warnings
- **Fix:** Gated all state updates (including debug) behind `isMountedRef` guard
- **Commit:** `2fc3fa2 feat: Xterm Terminal Core - TauriTerminalService IPC bridge (#34)`

### 3. Unstable `fileSystemService` instance triggers reloads that overwrite in-progress edits

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #38 round 1 | 2026-04-10
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **File:** `src/features/workspace/WorkspaceView.tsx`
- **Finding:** `WorkspaceView` created a new `fileSystemService` on every render via `const fileSystemService = createFileSystemService()`. CodeEditor's file-loading effect listed `fileSystemService` in its deps, so every WorkspaceView re-render (including each keystroke) triggered a fresh `readFile` → `updateContent`, overwriting the user's in-progress edits with stale disk content.
- **Fix:** Memoize with `useMemo(() => createFileSystemService(), [])` so the reference is stable across renders.
- **Commit:** `dd4fc02 fix: address Codex review round 1 findings`

### 4. `requestAnimationFrame` callback calls methods on destroyed EditorView

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #38 round 8 | 2026-04-10
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/editor/hooks/useCodeMirror.ts`
- **Finding:** After creating the EditorView, the `setContainer` callback scheduled an rAF to call `view.requestMeasure()` and `view.focus()`, with no guard that the view was still alive when the frame fired. Rapid unmounts (hot reload, StrictMode double-invoke, tab switches) could destroy the view between schedule and fire, calling methods on a destroyed instance. CodeMirror currently no-ops after destroy but this is not a stable public contract.
- **Fix:** Add a `viewRef.current === view` liveness guard inside the rAF callback.
- **Commit:** `3e0304f fix: address Claude review round 8 findings`

### 5. `initialContentRef` updated async via useEffect — empty editor on first file open

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #38 round 9 | 2026-04-10
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/editor/hooks/useCodeMirror.ts`
- **Finding:** `initialContentRef` was updated via `useEffect`, which runs AFTER the commit phase. React invokes `setContainer` during commit when the new container div is attached — on the first file-open transition, the effect had not fired, so `setContainer` read the stale ref value (empty string) and created the EditorView with an empty document. One frame later `updateContent` filled it in, producing a visible blank flash.
- **Fix:** Update the ref synchronously in the render body (`initialContentRef.current = initialContent`). Ref mutations during render are allowed for this "latest value" pattern — `setContainer` (running during commit) will always read the value written during the matching render.
- **Commit:** `3aa2c5d fix: address Claude review round 9 findings`

### 6. `handleFileSelect` not memoized — unstable reference passed 4 levels deep

- **Source:** github-claude | PR #38 round 2 | 2026-04-10
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **File:** `src/features/workspace/WorkspaceView.tsx`
- **Finding:** `handleFileSelect` was a plain arrow function passed 4 levels deep (WorkspaceView → Sidebar → FileExplorer → FileTree → FileTreeNode), creating a new reference on every WorkspaceView render — which happens on every keystroke because `editorBuffer.currentContent` is state. No current render waste because the intermediate components aren't memoized, but the unstable reference would silently defeat any future `React.memo` adoption on the subtree.
- **Fix:** Wrap in `useCallback` with deps on the `isDirty` slice and `openFileSafely` identity. Matches the pattern used by every other handler in the file.
- **Commit:** `0c8f0ac fix: address Claude review round 12 findings`
