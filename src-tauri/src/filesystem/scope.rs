//! Filesystem sandbox primitives.

//! These helpers enforce the `$HOME`-rooted sandbox boundary for all

//! for symlink refusal, canonicalization, and scope checks.
//!
//! **Do not inline these checks in command modules.** Every sandbox
//! primitive lives here so that `list.rs`, `read.rs`, and `write.rs`
//! cannot silently diverge. See `SECURITY.md` in this directory
//! for the full threat model and a map of each primitive to the
//! review findings it prevents.
