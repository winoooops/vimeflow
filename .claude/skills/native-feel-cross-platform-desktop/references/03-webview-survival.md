# 03 — WebView Survival Guide

This is the densest file in the skill. Every section is a real, reproducible bug in `WKWebView` or `WebView2` when you try to use it as a native UI rendering surface instead of as a browser embed. For each, the symptom, the cause, and the exact fix.

If you take only one tenet from `references/01-philosophy.md` into this file, take T3 — _adopt the platform; don't compete with it_ — paired with its inverse corollary: when the platform's default actively _breaks_ native feel (as many WebView defaults do, because they were designed for browser embedding, not native UI), override it precisely and only there. Most of these bugs exist because the WebView's defaults assume it is hosting a webpage, not a native app.

## Section A — macOS / WKWebView

### A.1 Hidden window throttling

**Symptom:** Open the launcher with a hotkey. The first animation hitches. Counters/timers seem frozen for the first frame. `requestAnimationFrame` fires at 1 Hz instead of 60 Hz when the window was offscreen.

**Cause:** WebKit aggressively throttles `requestAnimationFrame`, CSS animations, and timers when it judges the view to be occluded or off-screen. For a hidden launcher that's prewarmed but invisible, _every_ WebKit heuristic concludes "this is not visible, slow it down." Browser-correct, native-app-wrong.

**Fix (three parts):**

```swift
// 1. Disable WebKit's occlusion detection on the host window.
//    Without this, WK will throttle even when the window is technically present.
window.setValue(false, forKey: "windowOcclusionDetectionEnabled")

// 2. To prewarm: order the window front but keep it visually invisible.
//    alphaValue = 0 keeps it in the front-layer for animation budgeting but invisible.
window.alphaValue = 0
window.orderFront(nil)
// …later, when actually showing:
window.alphaValue = 1

// 3. Keep the render loop "warm" by firing periodic rAFs from JS.
//    A no-op rAF cycle convinces WebKit the page is actively animating, so the
//    full 60 / 120 Hz frame budget stays allocated. Critical on first show.
```

In JS:

```js
// Run inside the prewarmed (alpha=0) WebView before the user-visible show.
function keepWarm() {
  requestAnimationFrame(keepWarm)
}
keepWarm()
```

Combined, the WebView believes it is visible (so it doesn't throttle), the rAF loop keeps its scheduler primed, and the user sees nothing until you flip alpha.

**Why this is safe:** You're not deceiving WebKit about anything that affects correctness — only about animation budgeting. Throttling is an opportunistic optimization, not a security boundary.

### A.2 Startup flicker — empty frame before first paint

**Symptom:** Window appears as a white/black rectangle for one frame, then content fades in. Especially visible on hotkey-triggered launches.

**Cause:** `NSWindow.orderFront()` makes the window visible _before_ the WebView has rendered its first frame. The window shows whatever the backing surface contains — which is empty.

**Fix:** Use the private but stable `_doAfterNextPresentationUpdate` API to synchronize window visibility with WebView paint completion.

```swift
webView.perform(Selector(("_doAfterNextPresentationUpdate:")), with: { [weak window] in
    window?.orderFront(nil)
} as @convention(block) () -> Void)
```

This call schedules a callback for after the next time WebKit hands a rendered frame to the system. Order-front _inside_ the callback. The window now appears with content already drawn.

**Caveat:** This API is private. It has been stable for ~10 years and Raycast Beta is shipping with it as of 2026. If Apple removes it, fall back to a fixed 50ms delay after `loadHTMLString` returns.

---

### A.3 Expand-from-compact rendering gap

**Symptom:** Compact launcher window grows vertically when results appear. The newly revealed area is blank for 1–2 frames, then fills in.

**Cause:** WebKit measures the visible viewport of `WKWebView`. When the WebView's _frame_ changes size, WebKit has to re-layout and re-paint the newly exposed region. There's a one-frame gap between "frame became taller" and "newly tall region painted."

**Fix:** Keep the `WKWebView`'s frame at the **maximum** size always. Resize only the host window. The WebView always has the full content rendered; the window simply unmasks more of it.

```swift
// Don't do this:
webView.frame = NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: windowWidth, height: currentContentHeight)

// Do this:
webView.frame = NSRect(x: 0, y: 0, width: windowWidth, height: MAX_HEIGHT)
window.setFrame(NSRect(..., height: currentContentHeight), display: true, animate: true)
```

The WebView is bigger than its container; the window clips it. Frame-perfect resize.

---

### A.4 Animated window resize stutters

**Symptom:** When the window animates (e.g., growing on result expansion), the WebView contents stutter or freeze mid-animation.

**Cause:** `NSWindow.setFrame(_:display:animate:)` with `animate: true` uses Cocoa's animation primitive that _suspends drawing on subviews_ during the animation. WebKit specifically opts out of drawing during this suspension.

**Fix:** Replace `animate: true` with an explicit Core Animation transaction:

```swift
NSAnimationContext.runAnimationGroup({ ctx in
    ctx.duration = 0.18
    ctx.timingFunction = CAMediaTimingFunction(name: .easeOut)
    ctx.allowsImplicitAnimation = true
    window.setFrame(newFrame, display: true)
}, completionHandler: nil)
```

Now the WebView keeps drawing every frame because it's a normal layer-backed view participating in implicit Core Animation, not subject to the legacy Cocoa animation suspension.

---

### A.5 Translucency / vibrancy / Liquid Glass

**Symptom:** You want the WebView to blend into the window's vibrancy material (frosted/blurred background). Default WebView paints opaque white.

**Fix:**

```swift
webView.setValue(false, forKey: "drawsBackground")
// And on the underlying scrollview/layer, ensure transparency:
webView.layer?.backgroundColor = NSColor.clear.cgColor
```

On the CSS side: do not set `body { background: white }`. Use `background: transparent` and let the window's `NSVisualEffectView` (or `Liquid Glass` material on macOS Tahoe/26+) show through.

**Liquid Glass specifically (macOS 26+):** Use `NSGlassEffectView` (the new material introduced for the macOS Tahoe-era design language) as the window's content background, and ensure the WebView is fully transparent above it.

---

### A.6 Context menu, link previews, magnifying glass

**Symptom:** Right-clicking opens WebKit's web context menu ("Reload", "Inspect Element"). Long-pressing on a word opens the Dictionary lookup. Force-touch reveals link previews.

**Cause:** Browser defaults. None of these belong in a native app.

**Fix:**

```swift
class CustomWebView: WKWebView {
    override func willOpenMenu(_ menu: NSMenu, with event: NSEvent) {
        menu.removeAllItems()  // or repopulate with native items
    }
    override func mouseDown(with event: NSEvent) {
        // suppress double-click word selection's auto-lookup if needed
        super.mouseDown(with: event)
    }
}
```

For Force Touch link previews, set the link's CSS `-webkit-touch-callout: none` or intercept at the navigation delegate.

---

### A.7 Popovers and tooltips inside the WebView

**Symptom:** Tooltips and popovers built as DOM elements inside the WebView don't match native styling, can be clipped by the window, can't extend beyond the window edge.

**Fix:** **Render popovers as native windows, not DOM elements.** When the React UI wants to show a tooltip, send an IPC message to the native shell:

```
{ kind: "show-popover", anchor: {x, y, w, h}, content: "…", direction: "below" }
```

The shell opens an `NSPopover` (mac) / a custom borderless `Window` (Windows). The native popover handles edge clipping, shadow, animation, focus. The WebView just _requests_ it.

This is one of the highest-leverage native-feel changes you can make.

---

### A.8 View transition / appearance flicker

**Symptom:** When the user navigates between views inside the same window (search list → result detail, sidebar item → panel), the screen shows a 1-frame flash of empty / unstyled / mid-painted content. Or: when a sheet or panel slides in, its first frame is empty before the content appears.

**Cause:** Three common sources, in order of frequency:

1. **Unmount-before-mount.** The new view's React tree starts rendering _after_ the old view is removed, leaving one frame where the container is empty.
2. **CSS code-split arriving late.** Vite/esbuild splits CSS per route. If the new route's stylesheet hasn't been fetched yet, the DOM renders unstyled for a frame (FOUC) before the CSS lands.
3. **The CSS View Transitions API is engaged with default keyframes**, which include a transparent gap in the middle of the cross-fade.

**Fix:**

1. **Cut, don't fade.** Native apps don't fade between sibling views inside a window. Kill any default transition:
   ```css
   /* If the View Transitions API is engaged */
   ::view-transition-old(root),
   ::view-transition-new(root) {
     animation: none;
   }
   ```
2. **Keep the previous view mounted until the new view has its first paint.** Concrete patterns:
   - React Suspense with `useDeferredValue` or TanStack Router's `pendingComponent: false`.
   - Render the previous content while `isFetching` and only swap when `data` is ready.
   - Two stacked layers with the new one mounted invisible until first paint, then swap visibility.
3. **Inline critical CSS, pre-fetch route CSS.** Configure your bundler to preload the next route's CSS the moment the user hovers/focuses an entry that could navigate there.
4. **Avoid the View Transitions API** unless you're using it deliberately for one specific surface. Its defaults assume web-page semantics, not native-window semantics.

The article specifically calls out "Elimination of view transition flickering" as one of Raycast's platform-convention adherence wins. It's small individually; collectively, the absence of these flickers is what makes a WebView UI stop feeling like a web app.

### A.9 Emoji and fallback-font cold start

**Symptom:** The first time the WebView renders an emoji or a CJK character that isn't covered by the primary font, there's a brief stutter — sometimes a missing-glyph rectangle for one frame, sometimes a layout jump as the fallback font is substituted in.

**Cause:** WebKit (like all text engines) consults a font cascade. If the primary font lacks a glyph, it falls through to platform fallbacks: emoji → `Apple Color Emoji`, CJK → `PingFang SC` / `Hiragino Sans` / etc. The first lookup against a fallback font is _not_ free — the font file has to be mapped, the glyph table parsed, the shaper initialized. On a cold start, this happens during user-facing rendering.

**Fix — prewarm the fallback fonts at startup.** Render a hidden span containing the expected fallback characters once, before any user-visible content needs them:

```js
// Run early in the WebView's lifecycle (before the launcher shows).
function prewarmFontFallbacks() {
  const span = document.createElement('span')
  span.setAttribute('aria-hidden', 'true')
  span.style.cssText =
    'position:absolute;left:-9999px;top:0;opacity:0;pointer-events:none'
  // Cover the fallbacks you actually use: emoji, CJK, math symbols, dingbats.
  span.textContent = '😀🎉✨📦🚀 中文 日本語 한국어 ∑∫√ ✓✗'
  document.body.appendChild(span)
  // One layout pass forces font resolution.
  void span.getBoundingClientRect()
  // Keep it briefly so Core Text retains the font in cache.
  requestAnimationFrame(() => requestAnimationFrame(() => span.remove()))
}
```

The double-rAF is intentional: it ensures the layout + paint both complete (registering the font with Core Text's cache) before the span is removed.

**Why this matters specifically for native feel:** Native apps rendered through AppKit/UIKit benefit from system-wide font caches that warm across processes. A fresh WebView process has its own font state. Without prewarming, the first emoji in an AI chat response visibly stutters in a way that no native app ever does.

### A.10 WebKit Feature Flags as a runtime power tool

**Symptom (or rather: opportunity):** WKWebView exposes — via private but stable APIs — the same feature flags Safari exposes in its Develop menu. Most apps never touch these. A few of them are decisive for native feel.

**The flags worth knowing about:**

- **`RequestIdleCallbackEnabled`** — enable `requestIdleCallback`, which is gated off by default in WKWebView. Use it for non-critical background work without `setTimeout` hacks.
- **The 60 Hz cap on ProMotion displays** — by default WKWebView paces at 60 Hz even on 120 Hz screens. There is a private setting (name varies by macOS version; check `WKPreferencesPrivate.h` or the `_WKExperimentalFeature` API) to unlock the full refresh rate. Enables genuinely 120 Hz scrolling and animation.
- **Experimental CSS features** — `:has()`, container queries, etc. — that may be gated on older macOS versions but stable.

**Mechanism (Swift):**

```swift
// Via _setBoolValue:forKey: on WKPreferences (private but long-stable).
// Exact key names vary by macOS version; enumerate via _WKExperimentalFeature.
let prefs = webView.configuration.preferences
prefs.perform(Selector(("_setBoolValue:forKey:")),
              with: NSNumber(value: true),
              with: "RequestIdleCallbackEnabled" as NSString)

// Or, more typed, via _WKExperimentalFeature:
for feature in WKPreferences._experimentalFeatures() {
    if feature.key == "RequestIdleCallbackEnabled" {
        prefs._setEnabled(true, for: feature)
    }
}
```

**The discipline:** Treat these like the rest of the private API surface (e.g., `_doAfterNextPresentationUpdate` from A.2). They are stable in practice but uncontracted. Wrap each flag toggle in a try/catch and a "is this macOS version" check, and have a fallback path.

**Why this matters:** The cap-at-60 issue is the single most common reason a Mac user with a ProMotion display says "this app feels stutter-y on my machine but smooth on my friend's." It is invisible to the developer who tests on a 60 Hz display. The fix is one private setting.

### A.11 Scroll inertia and rubber-banding

**Symptom:** Scrolling lists feels like scrolling a web page (slightly delayed, document-style inertia) rather than like scrolling a native list (snappier, contact-tracking).

**Fix:** This is hard to fully fix because WebKit owns the scroll physics. Mitigations:

- Use `overscroll-behavior: contain` in CSS to kill the rubber band on inner scrollers.
- For your hottest list (the search results), consider rendering it natively (above the WebView as a native overlay) and only using WebView for the parts that don't scroll. Most apps don't do this; it's a hard-mode option.

## Section B — Windows / WebView2

### B.1 Initialization white-rectangle flash

**Symptom:** When WebView2 initializes inside your window, there's a 100–300 ms white flash before content paints.

**Cause:** `CoreWebView2` initializes asynchronously. Your window is visible before the WebView has loaded its environment, navigated, and painted.

**Fix:**

1. Start the WebView2 environment _before_ showing the window:
   ```csharp
   var env = await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(
       userDataFolder: appDataPath,
       options: new CoreWebView2EnvironmentOptions {
           AdditionalBrowserArguments = "--disable-features=msSmartScreenProtection",
       });
   await webView.EnsureCoreWebView2Async(env);
   ```
2. Set `webView.DefaultBackgroundColor = Color.Transparent` (or your window background color) _before_ `EnsureCoreWebView2Async` completes — the default is white.
3. Don't show the window until `NavigationCompleted` fires for the first time.

---

### B.2 Acrylic blur with custom title bar

**Symptom:** You want acrylic blur behind the WebView with a custom (chromeless) title bar. The acrylic doesn't render, or the WebView paints opaque on top of it.

**Fix (Windows 11+):**

1. Enable acrylic on the window via `DwmSetWindowAttribute` with `DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE = DWMSBT_TRANSIENTWINDOW` (acrylic) or `DWMSBT_MAINWINDOW` (mica).
2. Extend client area to entire window: `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea(hwnd, new MARGINS { cyTopHeight = -1 })`.
3. Set WebView2 background to transparent: `webView.DefaultBackgroundColor = Color.FromArgb(0, 0, 0, 0)`.
4. In CSS: `body { background: transparent; }`.
5. Handle hit-testing manually for drag regions (CSS `-webkit-app-region: drag` works in WebView2 only with `IsNonClientRegionSupportEnabled = true`).

This is finicky. Test on Windows 10, 11, 11 22H2, and 11 24H2 — each had subtle changes.

---

### B.3 Background window throttling (Chromium)

**Symptom:** Your app needs to update its tray icon, refresh data, or render notifications while the main window is hidden. Chromium throttles aggressively.

**Fix:**

```csharp
webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.IsBackgroundResourceLoadingEnabled = true;
// And via additional browser arguments at env creation:
AdditionalBrowserArguments = "--disable-renderer-backgrounding --disable-background-timer-throttling --disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows"
```

Chromium will still suspend the _frame_ (no painting), but timers and JS execution continue. If you need actual rendering while hidden (rare), keep the window at `alphaValue`-equivalent (Win32: `SetLayeredWindowAttributes` with alpha 0) instead of `Hide()`.

---

### B.4 Per-window WebView2 environment

**Symptom:** Multiple windows share one WebView2 environment. One window's crash takes down all of them.

**Fix:** Create one `CoreWebView2Environment` per _logical window kind_, with appropriate user data folder isolation:

```csharp
var envForLauncher = await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(
    userDataFolder: Path.Combine(appData, "launcher"));
var envForSettings = await CoreWebView2Environment.CreateAsync(
    userDataFolder: Path.Combine(appData, "settings"));
```

This is more memory but isolates failure domains. Settings window crashing should never kill the launcher.

---

### B.5 IME / composition input

**Symptom:** CJK input methods (Pinyin, Japanese kana, Korean) misbehave inside the WebView — wrong composition box position, ghost characters, or events fire twice.

**Cause:** WebView2 forwards IME events but the focus model between WPF/WinUI and WebView2 doesn't always agree on which control has focus.

**Fix:**

```csharp
webView.GotFocus += (_, _) => {
    // Ensure WebView2 receives IME events
    webView.CoreWebView2.Settings.IsBuiltInErrorPageEnabled = true;
};
// In your custom title bar, make sure it doesn't steal focus
titleBarPanel.Focusable = false;
```

Test with Pinyin specifically — it's the most demanding combination of fast typing + composition window + candidate selection.

---

## Section C — Cross-platform behaviors

### C.1 Do not show `cursor: pointer` on rows

Native apps do not change the cursor on hoverable list items. Web apps do. The single most "this feels like a web app" tell.

```css
.row,
button,
a {
  cursor: default;
}
```

Override only for true draggable handles or text-selection-disabled areas where a different cursor is platform-conventional.

---

### C.2 Disable text selection by default

Native widgets do not allow selecting the text in their labels. Web pages do.

```css
* {
  user-select: none;
  -webkit-user-select: none;
}
.user-content,
.editable {
  user-select: text;
} /* opt back in */
```

---

### C.3 Match platform scrollbar conventions

macOS: scrollbars only appear while scrolling (overlay style). Windows 11: thin scrollbars by default; classic scrollbars otherwise.

```css
/* macOS */
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  ::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 8px;
  }
  ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
    border-radius: 4px;
  }
}
```

Better: send a CSS variable from the host shell encoding the platform's scrollbar policy and conditionally render.

---

### C.4 Disable smooth-scroll JS polyfills

Browsers added smooth-scrolling JS APIs that _feel_ premium on the web. They feel laggy in a native app.

```js
window.scrollTo({ top: y }) // default 'auto' — instant, native
// Avoid:
window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: 'smooth' })
```

---

### C.5 No page transitions

Native windows don't fade between pages. They cut. Make sure your router (React Router etc.) is not animating transitions.

---

### C.6 Honor system reduced-motion preference

Cheap and high-impact:

```js
const reduced = window.matchMedia('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)').matches
```

Disable your show/hide animations when this is true. Native apps already honor this; users will notice if you don't.

---

## How to use this file

When the user reports a specific symptom ("the window flashes white on launch"), grep this file for the symptom verbatim and apply the fix. Don't reinvent.

When the user is _designing_ their WebView host, read sections A and B end-to-end and apply preventively. Most of these bugs are easier to design around than to fix after the fact.
